<h1>Lipid Structure Hierarchy</h1>
<p> Situated in the left of the the browser the lipid structural hierarchy is the starting point for browsing through the data in LipidHome. Organised as a tree elements are organised into the category, main class, sub class, species, fatty acid scan species, sub species and isomers nomenclature as defined in the LipidomicNet nomenclature structural hierarchy. In combination with the child list users can navigate step by step down the structural hierarchy to view data on the higher resolution children of the current lipid.</p>

<p>After a long session of browsing the data in LipidHome data the structural hierarchy tree can become quite cluttered, to sovle this nodes of the tree can be collapsed. When collapsed any children do no disappear, all data is stored locally along with any customisation of the GUI and filtering of the data.</p>
