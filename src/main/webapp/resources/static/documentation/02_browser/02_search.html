<h1>Lipid Search</h1>
<p>The lipid search bar offers a free text live search of the LipidHome database. From the combo box to the right of the search box the level of the database can be selected, e.g. if you were specifically searching for a lipid sub species, that level could be selected and only lipids at the structural hierarchy level would be searched against. As a default all structural levels of the database are search against after a minimum of 4 characters have been entered. Results are returned as a pageable list with 10 results per page, these results are ordered primarily by the identification status followed by structural hierarchy level followed by name alphabetically.</p>

<p>After selecting a result the lipid is automatically loaded into the structural hierarchy and displayed in the information panel with its children below it in the children list.</p>
