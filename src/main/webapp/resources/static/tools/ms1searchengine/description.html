    <h1>MS1 Search Engine</h1>
    <p>
        This <b>tool</b> provides search engine functionality for MS1 (precursor ion) identification.
    </p>

    <p>
        Usage: A list of new line separated masses are pasted into the input box of the input panel,
        appropriate settings are entered for the mass tolerance and the structural level of
        identifications ( precursor ion masses only have the capability to map to species level,
        however however levels can be selected in order to return the entire complement of matching
        lower level structures.) After configuration masses are submitted and the output will be
        available shortly after in the output panel.
    </p>

    <p>
        Result: For each mass a table of results is displayed, this table identifies all the database
        entries that correspond to this mass. BY default they are ordered by whether they are identified
        (described in an external resource) followed by mass delta. As with most components in the LipidHome
        web application these columns are sortable, filterable and customisable by the user by clicking
        on the column headers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Results can be exported to anyone of the following file formats and downloaded for offline
        inspection and further analysis.
