<h1>Children Information</h1>
<p>The information regarding the children of the selected lipid is located at the bottom right of the browser. Children are displayed in a table of their most important properties. This table is extremely flexible, columns can be sorted, removed and resized to organise the data as the user sees feet. In addition columns can be filtered to remove any uninteresting children and allow the user to focus on their interests. For example in the children information of the sub class diacylglycerophosphoinositols users may filter the children species for the mass range > 500.00 < 600.00 by simply clicking the mass column header and entering the filter values</p>

<p>The theoretical fatty acid combinations feasible for a lipid species can be particularly useful information amongst other children information tables. After filtering and sorting the table users may export this information to a number of data exchange or spreadsheet parse-able formats for further analysis off line using the export results option.</p>
