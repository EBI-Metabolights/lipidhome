<h1>Lipid Information</h1>
<p>The information panel in the top right of the browser gives general statistics about a selected lipid, including the number of children it has at the various levels of structural hierarchy, a render of the molecule and some structural hierarchy level specific infromation such as mass and formula. The molecules are rendered using a fork of the ChemDoodleWeb library originally available at http://web.chemdoodle.com/ with the fork available at http://code.google.com/p/lipidhome-molrender/</p>

<p>In additon to general statistics about coverage of the lipid in the database and it's general molecular properties,subject specific tabs are provided along side the general information tab. The Xrefs (cross references) tab provides links to other resources on the web that contain information on the selected lipid inlcuding LIPID MAPS, KEGG, PubChem and ChEBI automatically annotated by the LipidHome xref pipeline. The papers tab gives access to a selection of journal article abstracts automatically annotated to the select species by the LipidHome paper pipeline, to faciliatate a literature search on particular lipids.</p>
