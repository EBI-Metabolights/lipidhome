<h1>Input</h1>
<p> A list of new line separated masses are pasted into the input box of the input panel, appropriate settings are entered for the mass tolerance. Precursor ion masses are capable of identifying lipids at the structural hierarchy level of species, they are not suitable for concretely identifying fatty acid scan species or sub species and so results are only provided at the species level. If the theoretical complement of the LipidHome database is considered unsuitable for your identification protocol, then the identified check box can be selected to only search input precursor ion masses against lipids flagged as identified in the LipidHome database (They can also be specifically filtered for at a later stage once results for all lipids are retrieved). Finally adduct ions may be selected, each precursor ion mass is processed with the selected adduct ion masses creating a set of masses for each precursor ion mass. A search is submitted to the database via the submit button, this process can take a considerable amount of time depending on the number of precursor ion masses to be searched and the additional search parameters, so please be patient.</p>
