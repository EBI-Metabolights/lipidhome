<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>LipidHome currently provides a single tool; MS1 search engine, however other tools are currently under development and will be accessible via the tabs at the bottom of the tools tab, where "Other tools" currently resides as a place holder. The general structure of a tool where possible will follow the same layout as the MS1 search engine to make using different tools easier for new users. Tools are split up into 3 main sections; input, output and description. Only a brief description is presented within the tool, for full documentation on a tool and its implementation users should consult that tools specific documentation page.</p>
