<h1>Search Implementation</h1>
<p>For each mass pasted in the list of precursor ion masses input box, the selected adduct ion masses are subtracted to produce a set of masses that constitute viable identifications with lipids in the database which are all in their non-adduct form. For each set of masses, its members are iterated over and individually searched against the database within the tolerance specified. Search masses that hit a mass in the database are cross referenced to the lipid(s) that share that mass and returned.</p>
