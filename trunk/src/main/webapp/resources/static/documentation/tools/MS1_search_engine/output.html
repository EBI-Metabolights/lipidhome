<h1>Output</h1>
<p>After submitting a search and waiting for the results, the output panel will expand to reveal the results. For each precursor ion mass a table of results is displayed in the same order as the precursor ion masses, each table identifies all the database entries that correspond to the search mass. By default they are ordered by whether they are identified followed by mass delta. As with most components in the LipidHome web application these columns are sortable, filterable and customisable by the user by clicking on the column headers. To the left of the results table a check box tree is used to filter results of the search by category, mainclass or sub class. Assuming some prior successful chromatography isolated the glycerophosphocholine fraction of lipids in a sample all other main classes can be de-selected to only show hits against glycerophosphocholines.</p>

<p>Results can be exported to a number of spreadsheet parse-able (TSV,CSV and XLS) and data exchange (XML and JSON) file formats and downloaded for offline inspection and further analysis. Exported results reflect those visible in the results grid, not the underlying total data, so any filtering by category, main class or sub class will be reflected in the results file.</p>
